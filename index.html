<a href="http://github.com/marianosimone/epub-thumbnailer">epub-thumbnailer</a> is a little script I wrote because I wanted to see thumbnails of my epub books while browsing my collection:

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="images/epub-thumbnailer-without.png">
</div>
Thumbnails for pdf, but not for epub

After doing some googling, and not being able to find what I wanted (but <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=278162">learning</a> <a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1046678">something</a> about the <a href="http://library.gnome.org/devel/integration-guide/stable/thumbnailer.html.en">matter</a>), I came up with epub-thumbnailer (you'll find download and install instruction at <a href="http://github.com/marianosimone/epub-thumbnailer">GitHub</a>):

<div style="text-align:center">
    <img src="images/epub-thumbnailer-with.png">
</div>
thumbnails for everyone!

which is not only better than nothing, but also better than pfd thumbnails, as it displays the cover, and not just the first page.

epub-thumbnailer can be integrated with nautilus, but also used as a stand-alone script, or even a a tool for some other project, you just have to:

<div>
user@computer:$ epub-thumbnailer
</div>

For example:

<div>
user@computer:$ epub-thumbnailer Lawrence\ Lessig\ -\ Free\ Culture.epub cover.png 128
</div>
will look into the epub to find its cover, and will generate a 128px png file (named cover.png)
